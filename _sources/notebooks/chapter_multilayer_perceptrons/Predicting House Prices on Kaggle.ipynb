    "# Predicting House Prices on Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have introduced some basic tools for building and training deep networks and regularizing them with techniques including weight decay and dropout, we are ready to put all this knowledge into practice by participating in a Kaggle competition. The house price prediction competition is a great place to start. The data is fairly generic and do not exhibit exotic structure that might require specialized models (as audio or video might). This dataset, collected by De Cock (2011), covers house prices in Ames, IA from the period of 2006â€“2010. It is considerably larger than the famous Boston housing dataset of Harrison and Rubinfeld (1978), boasting both more examples and more features.\n",

    "In this section, we will walk you through details of data preprocessing, model design, and hyperparameter selection. We hope that through a hands-on approach, you will gain some intuitions that will guide you in your career as a data scientist.\n",
